# Converting JEE Timer to Android App

## Option 1: PWA (Progressive Web App) - Recommended
Your app is already built as a PWA and can be installed directly on Android devices:

### Installation Steps:
1. **Deploy your app** using Lovable's publish feature
2. **Open the deployed URL** in Chrome/Firefox on Android
3. **Add to Home Screen** - Browser will show "Install App" prompt
4. **App works offline** and behaves like a native app

### PWA Features Already Included:
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ Home screen installation
- ✅ Full-screen experience
- ✅ Background timer support
- ✅ Local data storage
- ✅ Works on Android 7+ (all modern browsers)

## Option 2: Capacitor (Native App)
Convert to a real Android APK:

### Setup:
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
npx cap init "JEE Timer" "com.programmerdeeapk.jectimer"
npm run build
npx cap add android
npx cap copy
npx cap open android
```

### Build APK:
1. Open in Android Studio
2. Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK
3. Follow the signing process
4. Install on device

## Option 3: Cordova (Alternative)
```bash
npm install -g cordova
cordova create JEETimer com.programmerdeeapk.jectimer "JEE Timer"
# Copy your build files to www folder
cordova platform add android
cordova build android
```

## Option 4: Online APK Builders
- **PWA Builder** (Microsoft): https://www.pwabuilder.com/
- **AppsGeyser**: Free but with ads
- **Appy Pie**: Paid service

## Recommended Approach:
1. **Start with PWA** - It's already working and installable
2. **If you need Play Store distribution**, use Capacitor
3. **For simple distribution**, use PWA Builder

## Current App Features:
- ✅ Works offline

- ✅ Touch-friendly interface
- ✅ Android-compatible
- ✅ Local storage
- ✅ Background timers
- ✅ PDF generation
